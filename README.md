# Milstone 2 Project (Unnamed yet)

For tghis project I am going to build a memory game designed for children. I have just learned this week I am going to become a father later this year so that is my motivation behind this game.

The game is simple enough so I'd like to make it look and play as appealing as possible for all users. I hope to implement a toggleable mode of some sort. I haven't decided yet but either a light/dark mode. Or possibly an entirely different theme.
 
## UX

###Overall Design Goal
This game is designed to be for kids first and foremost but I hope to make it appealing for users of all ages. Given the target audience I have set myself a simple goal of once the site is loaded that a kid can easily use the game without help from an adult. I will accomplish this by creating a user friendly interface and implementing clear feedback for the user with every feature.

###User Stories
####All Users
-As a general player of this game, I want to be encouraged to play and to receive feedback with every action made so I can understand the functions of the application.
-As a general player of the game, I want to have my visual and auditory senses stimulated by enjoyable colours and sounds. I want to experience reward type feedback from positive action, (ie. matching a card/completing a round) to create a sense of accomplishment.

####Kid Focused User Stories
-As a kid using this game for the first time, I want to be excited by the theme and colours and compelled to play the game, so that I can interactively exercise my cognitive functions of memory and recognition.
-As a kid using this game for the second time, I want the ability to change the theme for a fresh experience and to beat my best score.

####Adult Focused User Stories
-As an adult playing this game for the first time, I want to enjoy being challenged and to find the game obviously suitable for a child. 
-As an adult user, I'd like to be able to contact the developer of the game.

------This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

 
### Existing Features
- Flip Counter
- Toggle Light/Dark mode. OR Day/Night mode. Chnages background, music and card back design for new experience.
- New Game Button.
- How to Play Pop up.
- Sound On/Off toggle.
- Game Over and Game Complete animation overlay.
- Contact Dev modal pop up.
- Link to Github repo.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
